# How To Code Simple Data


A course taught by Proffesor [Gregor Kiczales](https://www.edx.org/bio/gregor-kiczales "edX Bio") and offered by the [University of British Columbia](https://www.edx.org/school/ubcx "University of British Columbia on edX") through [edX](https://www.edx.org "edX Website") with a focus on learning a systematic programming method rather than a programming language.

## Learning Outcomes Include: 
* Develop program requirements
* Produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later
* Make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.
* How to represent information as data
* How to focus each part of your program on a single task
* How to use examples and tests to clarify what your program should do
* How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns
* Recognize and represent more complicated information
